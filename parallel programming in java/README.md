Parallel programming in java

Parallelism is when multiple tasks OR several parts of a unique task literally run at the same time, e.g. on a multi-core processor. Parallelism does not require two tasks to exist. It literally physically run parts of tasks OR multiple tasks, at the same time using the multi-core infrastructure of CPU, by assigning one core to each task or sub-task.

> In a single-core CPU, we may get concurrency but NOT parallelism.
