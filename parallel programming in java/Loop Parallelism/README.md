# Loop Parallelism
Loop Parallelism

###### Objectives
- Create programs with loop-level parallelism using the Java Stream constructs
- Evaluate loop-level parallelism in a matrix-multiplication example
- Examine the barrier construct for parallel loops
- Evaluate parallel loops with barriers in an iterative-averaging example
- Apply the concept of iteration grouping/chunking to improve the performance of parallel loops
